## 🎨 Feedback Best Practices

### Constructive Comments
```
❌ "This is wrong"
✅ "Consider using Array.find() here for better readability and performance"

❌ "Bad variable name"  
✅ "Could we use a more descriptive name like `userNodeVersion` instead of `v`?"
```

### Security Focus
```
✅ "This shell execution could be vulnerable to injection. Consider using a parameterized approach."
✅ "Ensure this user input is validated before processing."
```

### Performance Considerations
```
✅ "This loop could be expensive with large datasets. Consider caching or optimization."
✅ "This could block the main thread. Should we make it asynchronous?"
```
